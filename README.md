## A Brief of the Prototype:
  Description:
  The model will be trained on image input which will be temporal in nature. Required data-preprocessing will be done using intel's oneDAL libraries. Further training will be done using HybridNet neural network Architecture with the intel's oneDNN pytorch optimization to perform faster training. Finally the real time inference will be achieved using the intel's oneDNN libraries which will provide mainly three outputs that are, object bounding box, object class and lane detection.
